  Added 4 hour estimate, probably 2, but always double the estimate
  Ran npm install and start to check the dev server works, curl'd the API and all seems fine

- 19:05
  Going to add the gherkin scenarios for viewing and filtering products

- 19:20
  Finished adding scenarios to the feature file, had to do a bit more curl to understand how the API filtering works.
  Next I'll set up the dev environment, add typescript and prettier etc

  nb: had to use `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` to get typescript installed with react-scripts

- 19:38
  While waiting for things to install I'm thinking about the best way of hooking up the API to the app. I think redux toolkit query will be a good fit. It'll give us caching and store integration for the results, not to mention hooks to use with the filters.

  Started to add RTKQ, realised I was missing the autogenerated tsconfig.json from CRA, so added one myself. Also had to add a custom type for svg file imports

- 19:58
  RTKQ set up
