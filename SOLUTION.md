# SOLUTION

## Estimation

Estimated: 4 hours

Spent: x hours

## Solution

Opting to use redux toolkit query to fetch data from the API and display it in a MUI table with pagination.

Looking at the full size dataset, it's only 12 items, which means filtering on the client-side will be quicker than utilising the API-level filters: "the fastest network request is the one you don't have to make". However if the dataset was much larger, creating API queries in RTKQ would be a good approach.

## Journal

- 19:00
  Added 4 hour estimate, probably 2, but always double the estimate
  Ran npm install and start to check the dev server works, curl'd the API and all seems fine

- 19:05
  Going to add the gherkin scenarios for viewing and filtering products

- 19:20
  Finished adding scenarios to the feature file, had to do a bit more curl to understand how the API filtering works.
  Next I'll set up the dev environment, add typescript and prettier etc

  nb: had to use `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` to get typescript installed with react-scripts

- 19:38
  While waiting for things to install I'm thinking about the best way of hooking up the API to the app. I think redux toolkit query will be a good fit. It'll give us caching and store integration for the results, not to mention hooks to use with the filters.

- 19:44
  Started to add RTKQ, realised I was missing the autogenerated tsconfig.json from CRA, so added one myself. Also had to add a custom type for svg file imports

- 19:58
  RTKQ set up

- 20:01
  Starting to think about how the page will look...sidebar + table. Because we have a state store, these can be completely isolated components. I'll start with the table.

- 20:30
  Added a MUI table with pagination and a dummy dataset. Time to hook it up to redux.

- 20:54
  Hooked up MUI table to API. Going to call it a night and pick it up again tomorrow.
  Time so far: 2 hours

- 10:00
  Picking this back up - first task is to finish off loading & error states in the product table.
  Will probably refactor rendering of the table to show states more effectively.

- 10:06
  Added skeleton loader

- 10:15
  Added error state and memoised row rendering
  Fix CRA react 18 reactDOM usage

- 10:20
  Split pagination into own component
  Time for a coffee...

- 10:30
  Time to start building filter state

- 10:37
  Added basic filter state. price defaults to -1, can probably improve that later

- 10:48
  Added query to get unique list of tags
  Added scenario for tag search

- 11:25
  Added tags filter and basic sidebar styling

- 11:48
  Configured jest and added search filter logic

- 11:55
  Added tag filter logic

- 12:04
  Hooked filter logic up to product table
